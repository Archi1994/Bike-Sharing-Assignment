# Bike-Sharing-Assignment
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes wants to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people. They want to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
In this assignment we will help them know which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bike and how well those variables describe the bike demands. This would be done by modelling the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. This model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market post Corona pandemic.
